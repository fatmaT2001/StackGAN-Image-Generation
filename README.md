# StackGAN-Image-Generation
This project implements Stage-I of StackGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates low-resolution images from textual descriptions. StackGAN employs a novel approach where Stage-I generates a coarse image. The project focuses on understanding the impact of different embedding models and datasets on the performance of StackGAN.
